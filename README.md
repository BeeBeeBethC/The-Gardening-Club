## The Gardening Club

## Features

## Testing

    I manually tested the Website on the Search Engines, Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge. 

    I also confirmed that the project is responsive and has a good consistent aesthetic across many standard screen sizes using the Chrome Devtools Device Toolbar. 

    I tested and confirmed the navigation bar works and is easy to read including the return to home page throguh the use of The Gardening Club logo at the top of the page so that users can always return home. 

    All links open in new windows to avoid losing the webpage when navigating to various external links. 

    I confirmed that the form works and ensured the placeholder text disappears when typing. 
    
    I also confirmed that the form needed to be completed fully in order to be able to submit information through the use of the form validation. 
    
    The submit button also works when all fields are filled out properly.

## Validator Testing

**CSS** 
CSS passed validating testing using jigsaw Ws3 validators no errors. 

**HTML pages**
HTML pages threw up a few errors on initial testing, these were:
 - Stray end tag in index.html (see screenshot) i'd applied an extra "div" closing tag. upon removal index.html validated no errors.
 - In the HTML document, 'about-us.html' I'd made a human error in my code in relation to aria tags and alt tags. I'd also missed a closing "div" tag. on removing the aria and alt tags and adding the closing div element, the HTML document passed with no errors or warnings.
 - In quick-tips.html I had a stray end tag in a line of code within my footer element of the website. 
 - I'd also put in trailing slash characters which were absolute so I removed those and on removal, the code validated. 

**Lighthouse scoring**
for portfolio project one, the main focus was accessibility. The lighthouse scores for this project are as follows:

- Performance scored 72
- Accessibility scored 100
- Best Practices scored 100
- SEO scored 100. 

To improve the performance score, I would need to further optimize the images selected and used within the website. 

## Unfixed bugs

## Deployment

    The Gardening Club was deployed to Github pages. The steps I took to do this are as follows below: 

    In the GitHub repository, I clicked on the "Settings" tab.
    navigated to the "Pages" tab on the left-hand sidebar.
    Under "Source" click the "None" dropdown and selected the "main" or "master" branch.
    then clicked "Save".
    Once the master branch had been selected and the browser has reloaded itself, the page then provided the link to the live deployed version of the website.
